#Radio Time Machine

This is the Python part of my Radio Time Machine Project.

Infos on the artefact: [here](RadioTimeMachine.pdf)

Usage: python main.py <Path/to/music/library>
Does only work on music libraries that have the date of release in their "Description" ID3 Tag, which at the moment
can only be achieved using manual input (If someone knows a good music library where I can get at least the month and year of release via
an api let me know), which means the use is really restricted at the Moment. Might go back to it someday
